# audio_processing

This working version includes three tyeps of audio processing: time domain, frequency domain, and time-frequency domain (spectrogram). It uses Tensorflow.js fft to compute both frequency domain analysis and time-frequency domain analysis (spectrogram).

## Developement Github site

The Github organization site that is developing web applications with Tensorflow.js is https://github.com/CodeSolutions2/audio_processing.

## [Working version: DEMO](https://codesolutions2.github.io/audio_processing/index3.html)


## In progress
  - A more user friendly version of the DEMO with file upload url input   
  - Audio-to-text Tensorflow.js model training and prediction
